# Shopify test products page

This is a simple test project to fetch products from any store and show on a standard web page with some styling.

## Builds

No framework is being used, so use any local server of your choice that supports html files. So in this instance no builds or compilation.

## To see the work

To see the work just a start a normal server. In this case live server vs code extension. First thing you will notice is an error page. That is normal.

1. Alter the code in index.js file, line 7: 

```function fetchProductsFromShopify () {
    const shopifyUrl = 'https://mystoreurlexample';// here make sure to add url of the store and json endpoint.
```
2. Once added refresh your server on the browser or refresh browser.

Enjoy!
